# Getting-Started-With-Unreal-Engine4-And-Paper2d
This is a guide specific to setting up Paper2D with a C++ Unreal Engine 4 Project. There isn't alot of information on this out there without scowering the internet or AnswersHub. So I took it upon myself to create a guide for newcomers to hopefully remove some early frustrations whilst creating your new Paper2D project.

# Step One
 If for some reason, you don't already have Unreal Engine installed. Install Unreal Engine 4 via:
